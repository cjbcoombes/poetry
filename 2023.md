A wall,  
once ignored,  
now appears an excellent tool  
with which to bloody my fist.

**Come Morning**  
6/1/23  
*Context: Wrote this after climbing West Mountain to see the sunrise with Mrs. Bundy's English class*  
*I like the first verse a lot, the second less so*

Come morning,  
does the sun  
left heavy colors to the brink?  
or ride them as a tide?  
in either case to crash and foam  
upon the silhouettes of mountains

Come evening,  
must the sun  
be cradled as it falls?  
or told to put away its light?  
in turn for nature's solemn oath  
to once again await her love  
come morning.
