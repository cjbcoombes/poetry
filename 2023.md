A wall,  
once ignored,  
now appears an excellent tool  
with which to bloody my fist.

**Two Minutes of Totality**  
4/8/24  
*Context: Just went to see the solar eclipse*

A lamp flickered  
for the gnats today.  
Brownian meanderings,  
directed lightward  
at a filamentâ€™s wink.  

So to what end  
meanders a world  
blind to beauty  
not packaged  
in a flicker.

**Silence**  
6/14/2024

I feel more silence  
in the wind.  
It steals the sounds  
that tell me  
I am really  
there.
